NxFitness Core - A PHP Fitbit API Project
=========================================

I've been using my Fitbit every day without break since I first got it in June 2012 and while the Fitbit dashboard is good, offering everything you could ever want, I felt the need to roll my own - as always. 
Fitbit offer a fantastic API which I aimed to make full use of. When I started my project I couldn't find anything else on the net like it. My project is slightly further along than this one, I am contacting 
the developer to offer my code and see if we can both work up a finished product.

NxFitness Core is stable and working on this site, but it is heavily tailored to my setup and the code has only recently been made public. The code is poorly commented and depends on my, but I am working on it.
If you are interested in this code please [email me](https://nxfifteen.me.uk/about/me/contact/)

## Demo
The best live example of this module can be found on my [own site](https://nxfifteen.me.uk/health/)
