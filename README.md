NxFIFTEEN / Fitbit API
======================
version = 0.0.0.1
version_dns = 0.0.0.1

I've been using my Fitbit every day without break since I first got it in June and while the Fitbit dashboard is good, offering everything you could ever want, I felt the need to roll my own - as always. Fitbit offer a fantastic API which I aimed to make full use of. When I started my project I couldnt find anything else on the net like it, but as I write this up now I have found a project already on [drupal's site](https://drupal.org/project/fitbit). My project is slightly further along than this one, I am contacting the developer to offer my code and see if we can both work up a finished product.

Nx-Fitbit is stable and working on this site, but it is heavily tailoured to my setup so I havent made the code public. I will do in the future, if there is any interest in it, but for now the code is poorly commented and depends on my [Core module](http://nxfifteen.me.uk/projects/drupal/modules/nx-research) which will not become a public product. If you are interested in this code please let me know in the [comments](#disqus_thread) or [email me](http://nxfifteen.me.uk/feedback)

## Demo
The best live example of this module can be found on my [own site](http://nxfifteen.me.uk/about/health)
